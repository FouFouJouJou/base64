* base64 encoder/decoder
This is a utility that attempts to simulate the basic functionality of a common CLI tool called [[https://command-not-found.com/base64][base64]]. It's an opportunity also to test out a build tool other than [[https://command-not-found.com/cmake][Cmake]].

* Requirements
- [[https://mesonbuild.com/][Meson]] is a build tool meant for extremely fast and user-friendly project builds. It's the first time I ever try to use it, and due to the relative simplicity of this project, I decided it was more than suitable as first crack at it.
