* base64 encoder/decoder
This is a utility that attempts to simulate the basic functionality of a common CLI tool called [[https://command-not-found.com/base64][base64]]. It's an opportunity also to test out a build tool other than [[https://command-not-found.com/cmake][Cmake]].

* Requirements
[[https://mesonbuild.com/][Meson]] is the only dependency required a build tool meant for extremely fast and user-friendly project builds. It's the first time I ever try to use it. Due to the relative simplicity of this project, I decided it was more than suitable as first crack at it.

* Installing Meson
The meson official site provides clear instructions on how to install the build tool for all platforms. I have been working on both a =GNU/Debian= and =NixOS= system for base64.

- For GNU/Debian users
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install meson
#+end_src
- For NixOS users

#+NAME: Adding to configuration
#+begin_src sh
  environment.systemPackages = pkgs [
    # packages
    python313Packages.meson
    # more packages
  ];
#+end_src

#+NAME: Installing using flakes

    flakes run nix-darwin -- switch --flake .#$USER
